# J LIGHT CAFE REST API PLUGIN

This is a plugin built to connect to a restaurant API and show the menu.
We're still working on getting access and meanwhile it is connecting to a
local rest api. This is up to date with REACT, Bable etc. This can be used
as a starting point for future Plugin Building.
